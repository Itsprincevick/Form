# Foundeet-Form-Page
This repository contains the desktop and mobile view for the Signup/Signin page,Reset password page and other pages that a user will interact with before logging into their Foundeet account.
## Breakdown of the Form-Page
React.js(Javascript) was used used to build the pages and Tailwind.css was used for the styling.
### Signup/Signin Page
Seperate components were used for the signin and signup page and then,a link tag was used to bind the two components together in order to navigate through both of them on thesame page.
Icons used on the two pages were imported from a heroicon npm package which was installed directly into the project.
#### Command to install heroicons
```http
  npm install heroicons
```
### Reset Password Page
For the reset password page,a simple React component was used which included a h1 tag, an input tag and a reset password button with all the necessary write ups.
### Reset Link Confirmation Page
This page contains a simple message that informs a user that their attempt to change their password via submitting their email on the Reset Password page was successful.
